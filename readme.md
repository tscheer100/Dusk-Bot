# Dusk Bot
A general purpose custom Discord bot that adds useful features as well as fun little tricks to keep members entertained.  

### What I've learned fomr this prroject:
- Tenerary Operators and how to use them to circumnavigate Discord embed's lack of support for regular `if-else` statements.
- familiarized myself with `.gitignore` as not to leak data to the public.
- learned about `.env` and how it can be used to seperate data from the rest of the code.
- strengthened knowledge on Discord's API with `discord.py`
