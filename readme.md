# Dusk Bot
A general purpose custom Discord bot that adds useful features as well as fun little tricks to keep members entertained.  

# requirements:
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- A bot token. must authorize [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [.env](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
- Python 3.x

### What I've learned fomr this prroject:
- Tenerary Operators and how to use them to circumnavigate Discord embed's lack of support for regular `if-else` statements.
- Familiarized myself with `.gitignore` as not to leak data to the public.
- learned about `.env` and how it can be used to seperate data from the rest of the code.
- Strengthened knowledge on Discord's API with `discord.py`
- Dipped my toes in the difference between handling discord specific errors and python errors. the discord specific errors can be found [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.DiscordException) 
- Dealt with SSH and raspberry pi. learned that pi zeros only support 2.4ghz band.
